# My Yard Our Message

This was a project done during the Summer of 2008 during the lead-up to the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. 

The project asked visitors to create yard signs following a specific template. Visitors to the website were then asked to vote on their favorite and most appropriate signs. The 50 highest ranked signs were printed and placed in three neighborhood galleries in St. Paul where residents had volunteered their laws. 

The archived version of the project can be found at: http://www.myyardourmessage.com/

## State of the code

This code was originally stored in SVN and I no longer have access to that repository and/or it no longer exists. I have several snapshpts during development which I have re-created as commits here. Some secrets and usernames may be visible in settings files, but they will no longer do anything. 

This was the first project I ever built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and I wanted to document it further. Obviously, this was done some time ago and django and my skills have evolved considerably since then.
